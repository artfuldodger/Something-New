== Something New

Do something new every day in 2011. See http://www.reddit.com/r/somethingnew

This app is basically a specialized and simple blogging platform as I figured a sub-reddit wasn't really the best way to approach this.

The goal is to get something done by the beginning of 2011 to enable people to track what they're doing each day and to get inspiration from others.

Minimum viable product:
  * accounts
  * ability to post what you do every day
  * see your history
  * see what other people have done.
  
Commenting and voting and stuff will be added eventually.
