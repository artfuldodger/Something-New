  <p>Do something new every day in 2011. See <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/somethingnew">the sub-reddit here</a>.

  <p>This website is basically a specialized and very simple blogging platform as I figured this could be a better way of keeping track of your activities and a way to make sure it's easy to look through your history, get inspiration, etc.</p>

  <p>The goal is to get something done by the beginning of 2011 to enable people to track what they're doing each day and to get inspiration from others.</p>
